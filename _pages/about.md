# 😁 About me
I am currently a final-year PhD student in the School of Automation at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), under the supervision of **Prof. Zhunga Liu**.
My research interests focus on open-environment deep learning and its applications in remote sensing, including open set recognition, incremental learning, and adversarial learning.
