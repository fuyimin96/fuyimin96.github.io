# 😁 About me
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the School of Automation at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU), under the supervision of **Prof. Zhunga Liu**.
My research interests focus on open-environment deep learning and its applications in remote sensing, including open set recognition, incremental learning, and adversarial learning.
Starting in 2025, I join Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) as a postdoctoral researcher, supervised by **Prof. Michael Kwok-Po Ng**.
